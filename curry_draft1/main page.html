      <p><p>PRISON IS by Lester Alford
        <br>Prison is a place where the flame in every man burns low; sometimes it goes out. But for most, it flickers weakly, sometimes flashes brightly, but never seems to burn as strong as it did before. 
        
        <br>Prison is a place where you can go for years without feeling the touch of a hand, where you can go for years without hearing a kind word. It’s a place where friendships are shallow. 
        
        <br>Prison is a place where you forget the sound of a baby’s cry, the sound of a cat’s meow, or the sound of the dial tone of a telephone. 
        
        <br>Prison is a place where you go to bed before you’re tired, where you pull the blankets over your head when you’re not even cold. It’s a place where you escape by reading, playing games, dreaming, or even going mad. 
        
        <br>Prison is a place where you see people that you don’t admire and you wonder if you are anything like them. It’s a place where you strive to stay civilized, but you know you’re losing ground. 
        <br>Prison is a place where you fool yourself, where you promise yourself you’ll a better man when you go home.
        
        <br> Prison is a place where you get out someday. When you do, you wonder how everyone can stay so calm when you’re so excited. When the bus driver goes over 25 MPH, you want him to slow down, but you don’t say anything because you know that’s foolish.
        
        <br> Prison is a place where you wake everyday and wonder if you’ll ever hear someone tell you they love you again and mean it. It’s a place where a hug from someone who truly loves and cares for you can get you through the next week, month, or year. 
        
        <br>Prison is a place where you realize that the things the outside world considers little actually mean the world to you. 
        
        <br>Prison is a place where no one wants to be, especially me. </p>
        <p>Alford’s poem helps illustrate how horrid the current state of prison is for people. He begins with the analogy of a weak flame to demonstrate that when one is incarcerated they are drained of their humanity. One loses physical and emotional connections when they lose touch with the society that exists outside prison walls. Prison is so disconnecting from the world that when one leaves the institution they are overwhelmed with the possibilities that they were denied behind bars. Even things someone outside of prison takes for granted, can cause extreme excitement (Alford). Mass imprisonment during the modern age is an issue that parallels the antiblack structures that created the conditions for slavery in America. When the 13th Amendment abolished slavery, it only abolished the practice for indivduals who were not incarcerated (Gilmore). This allowed the remanants of slavery to survive within the prison industiral complex. Issues with reading and writing among America’s prison population is one of the vestiges of slavery that is still preveclant. There is a lack of reading materials amongst inmates that reveals the ideological underpinnings of mass incarceration. Beginning in the 1960s, researchers studied how people who do not learn to read or write are more likely to become imprisoned. The goal of the prison system is not to rehabilitate people, to educate them or to prepare them for life after prison, it is to instill a certain knowledge (or lack of knowledge) amongst these people that protects dissent against a structure that works to contain them. The material consequence is an increase in recidivism. Literacy grants authority to people and the prison system will do anything to strip inmates of their autonomy and power (Kirkland). This reflects the urge of slave owners to prevent their slaves  from learning how to read and write because then they could form revolutions. Literacy has historically been seen as access to some sort of power so withholding this power from inmates can allow dominant racial hierarchies to exist unhindered.  Prisons ban books and the reasons why they exist do not make sense. It is to keep black men uneducated and in the prison system since they are unable to learn about their social conditions and how to challenge this oppression (Zaveri). By looking at bans that are directed at content and bans that are based on where the book comes from can show two ways that the prison system seeks to dim the flame of people who are incarcerated. </p></p>

      <p>There is a literacy crisis among inmates in America’s prison system due to a purposeful lack of books in these institutions. When speaking about education and the prison system, people often look to the success stories of those who beat the system rather than the majority of those who are imprisoned that cannot read. Malcolm X is a good example of someone who utilized the prison library to better himself. But today, there is a lack of reading materials for adults in custody because of book bans. Oftentimes, prisons eliminate certain books saying that they could “present risks of escape'' or that contraband could be smuggled inside the book. Thousands of books are banned nationwide including books about police brutality. Specifically, The Arizona Department of Corrections banned a book titled “Chokehold: Policing Black Men,”' which describes the subjugation of black men within the prison system (Zaveri). Writing and acts of publication that are banned from prisons are ones that hold certain values that officers think may cause chaos among inmates.
        Courts have allowed officials to censor reading materials in prisons if it is viewed as a threat to security. But this has been used to ban books on civil rights, human rights, and american history and many books by black authors. These people rarely tell why books are banned even when asked. The EJI made a comprehensive report on racial lynchings of black people and Florida banned it as a threat to prison security. Later Alabama banned Slavery By Another name which is about racial oppression and was sued by EJI. Then subsequently lifted the ban. These bans reveal that officials care about power over the content inside prisons more than they do about the education prisoners deserve (“Banning Books in Prisons”).
        Problems came about in New Jersey after the ACLU was notified of “The New Jim Crow" being banned. This book talks specifically about black men and mass incarceration and notes how the criminal justice system is used in similar ways to oppress as Jim Crow laws were. The ACLU-NJ Executive Director, Amol Sinha, said, "Michelle Alexander’s book chronicles how people of color are not just locked in, but locked out of civic life, and New Jersey has exiled them even further by banning this text specifically for them.” The organization also pointed out how New Jersey is the worst nationally when it comes to black incarceration rates with black people imprisoned at 12 times the rate of whtie people. New Jersey repealed the ban and noted how it can be taught in college curriculums. Reports of New Jersey's prison systems show that material bans are made independently by each facility and the corrections organization is going to review this (Barker).
        A former inmate, Michael Tofolla, recalls how reading a book titled Illegal:Reflections of an Undocumented Immigrant changed his life when he was incarcerated. Shortly after he was released, the book was banned due to racially motivated content. The 200 book ban as a part of an education program told the students, who are mostly blac men, that the prison has the final say over their lives. These books affirm the prisoners' humanity which allows them to be rehabilitated. Kansas banned The Hate U Give and The Bluest Eye but allowed Mein Kampf on the shelves. A report from the RAND corporation shows that education in prison decreases recidivism and for every dollar spent to educate a prisoner, taxpayers saver $5 on reduced incarceration costs (Gaines).
        Books about slavery or mass incarceration are the most targetted which books like The New Jim Crowe and Black Liberation Movements being banned. That is a content targeted ban (Gullapalli).  
        The book Slavery by Another Name which is about black people in Alabama becoming re-enslaved after the Civil War because of the arbitrary arrest of them. Because these people couldn't pay their legal fees, they were forced to work on mines, railroads, farms, and quarries. No where in the book does it advocate for “violence or a violence ideology, nor does it attempt to incite violence based on race,” according to the lawsuit placed by EJI. One Inmate received the book and was told by a captain that he couldn't have that book in the prison. The prison, Mark Melvin, filed a grievance stating that the book is simply history. This ban reveals how America cannot deal with the racial underpinnings of their carceral state. The lawyer, Mr. Stevenson states that “the need for more informed thinking about race and discrimination is especially critial in prisons,” since they are disprorportionately occupied by black men. There is denialism in dealing with the racism history of Americans (“Melvin v. Thomas”).
        There was a controversy with the Illinois prison system when they suspended an educational program and only reinstated it after banning 200 books that had racial content. The program's materials have undergone the review process but this process is ever changing with seven revisions in the last four years. Books that passed the process included “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn”, “Notes on the State of Virginia and the Declaration of Independence, and computer science books. Some books were approved, as long as some sections of the course readers were torn out and thrown away. The memo on the controversies noted on how the program’s handbook “contained an entire section about Diversity and Inclusion… which is an issue that is currently under investigation.” The university program was reinstated without the 200 books that were removed from the prisons (Nickeas). 
         The other type of ban is content ban which can happen from a glimpse at a single page. They believe that awareness of history, oppression, and liberation are a threat to the industrial complex. It reveals a belief in what knowledges the carceral institution attempts to repress (Tager).

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Indirect bans</h1>
      <p>During banned book week, organizations pointed out that the most extensive censorship happens in prisons since 2.3 million people are affected daily. There has been increasing amounts of book bans in carceral institutions in the past 30 years according to the Human Rights Defense Center. Texas has over 10.000 books banned and Florida is the worst with over 20.000 bans. A second type of ban is one where prisons will only buy from their preferred vendors instead of accepting used books, books from nonprofits, books from family or friends. These prisons often force prisoners to buy their own books instead of having a library when they only earn pennies an hour (Gullapalli). 
        There is no reviewer of the book bans that are independent of the prison system and there is no outlined criteria about what should be banned. This is a failure on the review system since it lacks checks. PEN demanded Congress to convene over the book banning practice in the prison system. Content neutral bans are about an indifference toward what education prisoners get since they only accept books from preferred vendors rather than free sources with more variety (Tager)
        In recent years, Washington state banned nonprofits from donating books to prisoners (Loera). And many prisons only accept books that have been given to them from preapproved sellers. This greatly reduces the variety and diversity of literacy materials that inmates have access to. The lack of circulation of reading material amongst the inmates reveals the ideological underpinnings of the prison industrial complex.

      <p>Poet’s Corner by George Hall
        <br>The times I have been at peace 
        <br>are almost beyond my memory’s reach
        <br>and sometimes I ask myself
        <br>have I ever really been there in here?
        <br>Or am I merely borrowing
        <br>from what I imagine it might be
        <br>but have never been able to see?
        
        <br>As I look back through my mind
        <br>in an attempt to find
        <br>the thing inside me that instills in kind
        <br>I keep coming back to where I am right now
        <br>standing here in front of you.
        
        <br>When I am up here reciting a poem 
        <br>I feel as if I am standing upon a pulpit
        <br>and my poem is the sermon
        <br>I am trying to preach
        <br>because I don’t always know
        <br>why I write what I write.
        <br>It begins with a thought veering away
        <br>off toward an idea 
        <br>and ends up flowing, going,
        <br>tossing about like a boat without oars
        <br>caught in the eddies of my emotions.
        
        <br>And then it dawns on me,
        <br>a time when I have felt at peace?
        
        <br>Right now, right here this moment
        <br>reading this poem to you
        <br>and what has been stuck inside me
        <br>and kept me going
        <br>beyond the call to end it all,
        <br>what has overridden the anger
        <br>and the pain and the hate
        <br>is my need to feel human and still alive.
        
        <br>And so when I come here to be with you
        <br>and listen to your poems
        <br>and read mine to you,
        <br>that is what you help me to feel,
        <br>that I am still alive,
        <br>that I am still a human being.
        
        <br>And that is as close to peace
        <br>as I will ever be again (Hartnett).</p>
        
      <p>This article was written by a former prison turned author who compares these bans to how slaves were forbidden to read so they would be more subservient. He outlines how the prison system is situated in a larger social problem with education in America. After being raised in a project with 10 buildings that had 7,000 black people. They didn't like education because those who graduated were not seen as cool and ridiculed if they thought being educated was the same as being smart. My favorite part about this articlw is when he compares books to ships “navigated by writers who recuse us when we find ourselves drowning in troubled waters.” Then he says that prisoners are drowning too often. It is a type of literacy genocide to deprieve the largest prison popultion in the world to certain materials (Soloman). </p>
