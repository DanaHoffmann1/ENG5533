# ENG 5533: Upload Files for Webtext Project Here
Students can upload files related to their projects in this repository. 
Because we won't be on campus, we will not be able to use the UMKC N drive to upload files and websites. 

Submit your project as a folder under the Code tab. Your folder will include any html files you used to create your project. 
The css file used to style or make the webtext look pretty.

# Note on Images and Videos
To make the creation of your webtext easier, I suggest adding videos using YouTube URLS (each video has an option to copy and paste
an embed code) or URLs for photos.
