# ENG 5533: Upload Files for Webtext Project Here
Students can upload files related to their projects in this repository. 
Because we won't be on campus, we will not be able to use the UMKC N drive to upload files and websites. 

Submit your project as a folder under the Code tab. Your folder will include any html files you used to create your project. 
The css file used to style or make the webtext look pretty.

# To Submit Files

1. Save all of your files in <b>one folder on your desktop</b>. Name the file LastName_Webtext. Example: Byrd_Webtext
2. Click on "upload files"
3. Drag the folder on your desktop into the upload file box
4. Click "Commit Changes" at the bottom of the page

# Note on Images and Videos
To make the creation of your webtext easier, I suggest adding videos using YouTube URLS (each video has an option to copy and paste an embed code) or URLs for photos rather than try to create them as files and upload them to your folder.

Directions on how to embed videos and images and URLS can be found at W3 Schools. Here are the links to those tutorials:
